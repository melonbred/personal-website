          Located in the San Francisco, Bay Area, I&apos;m an engineer by day
          with a love for tinkering and learning. Some other hobbies of mine
          include skateboarding, snowboarding/skiing, photography, and all
          things outdoors.

          My mechanical keyboard journey started around early 2018. Like many
          others, I found the mechanical keyboards subreddit and stumbled
          quickly down the rabbit hole. It wasn&apos;t long until my eyes met
          with a Daisy 40% keyboard and was instantly intrigued with the small
          form factor and usability.

          After a year into the hobby, the idea of tinkering and creating became
          far more interesting than just consuming. So with the encouragement
          from friends and the 40% keyboard community, I decided to give it a
          go.{" "}

        <p className="pt-5">
          Fast-forward to present day, and I&apos;ve been fortunate enough to
          have drawn up a handful of keyboards! With help from some dear friends
          and wonderful community members, some of these creations have made it
          to several hundred of people's desks and workstations.
