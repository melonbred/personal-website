          <p className="pt-2">
            Pegasus is the first in the Mythics series keyboards. A 40% keyboard
            with a 12.75u &quot;WKL&quot; layout and 0.75u blockers, this
            project was as much as an experiment as all the projects that came
            before it. A 4-piece construction that offers a unique win keyless
            (WKL) layout, Pegasus was a premium offering into the 40% keyboard
            space.

          <h2 className="pt-10 text-2xl">Case Construction</h2>
          <p className="pt-5">
            The 4-piece construction includes components typical of many
            keyboards: top, bottom, switch plate and weight. However, what is
            unique about Pegasus is the plate mounting solution. The switch
            plate is a half plate that is integrated into the raised bezel
            commponent of the keyboard. This component is then sandwiched
            between the case and bottom components, isolated by open-cell foam
            strips. The idea was to provide a soft, flexible typing experience
            in the alphas while offering a stable platform in the modifiers for
            tap-hold functions.
          </p>
          <p className="pt-5">
            The weight featured an engraving of a Pegasus and was offered in raw
            brass and polished stainless steel.
